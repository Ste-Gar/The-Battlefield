# The Battlefield
This is a Unity game I developed for the GameDev.tv 2022 GameJam.
It was developed in 10 days; all of the code is written by myself, while most assets (models, textures, animations, audio, UI) are CC0.

# Requirements
The project was developed in Unity 2021.3.2f1 and the following packages are required to run it in editor:
- Universal Render Pipeline (12.1.6)
- Cinemachine (2.8.4)
- Visual Effect Graph (12.1.6)
